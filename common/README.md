# Common

Shared utilities and components for the autonomy project. This module provides essential building blocks used across different parts of the system.

- `params/`: Persistent configuration storage using CPP and Cython for efficient key-value data handling.
- `ratekeeper.py`: Rate limiting utilities to control the frequency of operations more efficiently than using time sleep.
