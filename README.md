# Autonomy

This repository contains machine learning components and tools to advance sunnypilot's capabilities in autonomous driving.

## Overview

The repository includes implementations and tools for:

- **Vision Encoders**: Neural network components for processing visual data from cameras.
- **Vision Classifiers**: Models for classifying objects and scenes in driving environments, such as street lights, pedestrians, etc...
- **Machine Learning Tests**: Test suites for validating ML models and modeld codebase.
- **Testing Capabilities**: Validated integration testing for troubleshooting and analyzing model performance.
- **Driving Model Merge Scripts**: Tools to combine multiple driving models into one.
- **Quantizers**: Algorithms for model quantization to optimize performance and size, able to downsample 1 GB models to 200MiB models.
- **Model-Specific Code**: Offloaded code from the sunnypilot repository for specific models.

## Repository Structure

- key:value pairs will be filled out here as the repo grows.
